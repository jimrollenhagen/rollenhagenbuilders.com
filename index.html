<!--The decision to remodel your home, probably your biggest investment, is very exciting and perhaps a bit overwhelming.  I, Scott Rollenhagen, work hard to make the whole process as painless as possible. I am a small company because I've chosen to be, so that I can offer the most personalized service to my clients.  I dont want to be the biggest remodeling company, I want to be the best remodelor. You can have peace of mind, knowing that your project will be done on time and within budget, by a reputable company, and that your home will work better for you when its all done. Although I have experience in many types of home remodeling, my specialties are kitchens, additions, sunrooms, finished basements, bathrooms, built-in cabinetry, new gas fireplaces and surrounds, and new bay windows and sliding glass doors.--><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,0,0" width="820" height="615" id="RollenhagenBuilders" align="top">
